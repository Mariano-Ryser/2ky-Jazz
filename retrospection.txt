We did ok when we werent distracted and some of us are really good at distracting other people and i myself get distracted very easily. 
This was also big trouble when it came to all communication, as seen in the presentation.
Overall i was pretty happy with my end result and how it all added up with Mariano's help.
Though the way we worked was pretty awful, no matter how hard i tried to keep us on track.
